Fertilizer Blending Tool

The steps to follow:
1.	Run or source “FertilizerTesting.R”. This incorporates the “cassavaCropMasterFunctions.R”
Here you will find several functions that support the running of “FertilizerTesting.R”

Read soil data for the five soil fertility classes. This is normally assumed that the average soil class is the FCY2. If  the fertilizer companies want to specialize for poor and fertilized soils differently let them define the tool should allow:
For Nigeria read the following:

"SoilData_fcy1_LGA.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy2_LGA.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy3_LGA.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy4_LGA.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy5_LGA.RDS"

For Tanzania read the following:

"SoilData_fcy1_Region.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy2_Region.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy3_Region.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy4_Region.RDS"
"SoilData_fcy5_Region.RDS"

2.	For Water Limited Yield (WLY) read the following RDS files:
'WLY_CY_FCY1_LGA_A.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY1_LGA_B.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY3_LGA_A.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY3_LGA_B.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY4_LGA_A.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY4_LGA_B.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY5_LGA.RDS'

For Tanzania read these RDS:
'WLY_CY_FCY1_Region.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY2_Region.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY3_Region.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY4_Region.RDS'
'WLY_CY_FCY5_Region.RDS'
To get the most of the dashboard:
Click the “Start Tour” button to see how the dashboard works.
Step 1: Give cassava information
Step 2: Specify how many fertilizer options you would like testing on. The minimum is 3. On the right you can fill out information for each of these fertilizer options.
Step 3: Fill out information for each of the fertilizer options you requested
Step 4: After filling out informatin for each fertilizer option, you are ready to submit for testing.
Step 5: On the right you can preview the plot and table before downloading 
Step 6: Save progress
Step 7: Download a high-resolution PDF
Step 8: Click on the AKILIMO icon to get to the AKILIMO website and see what we do.
The Plot:
The plot comprises of a table that presents the different scenarios and a plot that shows the price ratios shown in the facets.
The Table:
This presents a table that gives a summary of the geographical region, planting month, price and fertilizers.
